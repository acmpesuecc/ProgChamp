The past week I've mainly gone through the tech stack provided and the overall architecture of the project.

I've gone through the uses of Hono + Svelte and their implementations in both back and frontend

I particularly went through the db and authorisation aspects of it and read up on:- 
-> The functions of R2 here in this project
-> The usage of Middleware 
-> Google OAuth integration

I wanna finish up readinng on all the aspects of the techstack and dev aspects.

Will start work on Profiles and Setup Routes in the upcoming week and hopefully get some work done.
