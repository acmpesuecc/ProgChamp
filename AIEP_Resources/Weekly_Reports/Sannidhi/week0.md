This week, I focused on familiarizing myself with the project’s tech stack and overall architecture. I primarily worked on the backend using Hono,trying to implement and organize server-side API routes to access games from the frontend. I gained a better understanding of request handling, routing structure, and how different services integrate within the application.This week, I focused on becoming more familiar with the project’s overall tech stack and architecture. I explored how the frontend and backend interact and understood how different parts of the system are structured. My primary work involved using Hono to implement and manage server-side logic for API routes.This helped me better understand how modern backend systems are designed and integrated within full-stack applications.
