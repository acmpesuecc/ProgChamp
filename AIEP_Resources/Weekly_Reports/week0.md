This week, I focused on mastering the Turso and Drizzle integration,
specifically analyzing how we handle relational logic like Many-to-Many mappings and staging workflows. 
I also developed the technical presentation slides to explain our data layer and core architecture.

Next week, I plan to explore the rest of our stack—including SvelteKit, Hono, and Cloudflare Workers—so 
we can officially begin active development on the project.
