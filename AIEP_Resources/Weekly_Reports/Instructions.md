- Create a subdirectory with your name under the WeeklyReports directory. 
This is where you guys will be putting your weekly updates. 

- You guys can create a branch with your name as the branch name and then push this change to that branch. Once you guys are done with the changes, create a PR to the main branch.

- For example: for week 0 - create a file named ```Week0.md``` in your sub-directory, and then create a PR.
