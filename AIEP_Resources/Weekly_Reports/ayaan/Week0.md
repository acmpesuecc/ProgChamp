## Syed Ayaan Hasan - Week0 report:

Explored the overall backend structure and folder organization to understand how the project is laid out.
Read through the schema file to understand the main entities like users, games, media, reactions, and how they relate to each other.
Looked into how authentication and sessions are handled at a high level to get a basic idea of request flow.

Created a branch from main under my name and pushed initial changes.

Will be focusing on the backend side, especially around authentication and middleware, in the coming weeks.
