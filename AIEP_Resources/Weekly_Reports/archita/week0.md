Archita Agrawal - Week0 report:

Researched on the complete tech stack as most of it was new to me. Also learnt about conventional git commits and revisited the git workflow.

Went through every file in the repository and got a sufficient understanding of the codebase.

Spent the most time understanding Node.js, Bun, Clouflare Workers + Hono and made presentation slides on them.
Also read about Drizzle ORM, Turso DB and SvelteKit.

Created a branch from the main branch under my name and created a PR to the main branch.
